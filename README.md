Project Overview
The Airbnb Data Analysis Project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project that aims to extract insights from Airbnb listing data. It examines different aspects of the Airbnb market, such as price distribution, booking frequency, property types, host activity, and seasonal trends.

The analysis is designed to benefit both Airbnb hosts and potential guests by providing actionable insights that can influence decision-making.

Data Source
The data used in this project comes from Airbnb's publicly available dataset, which includes various details about property listings, such as:

Property ID
Location (City, Neighborhood)
Price per night
Number of reviews
Property type (Apartment, House, etc.)
Host details
Availability
Amenities
You can download the dataset from Inside Airbnb, or any available source.

Goals of the Project
The primary objectives of this analysis are:

Understanding Price Distributions: What factors influence the pricing of properties?
Identifying Popular Locations: Which neighborhoods or cities attract the most bookings?
Analyzing Property Types: What types of properties are most in-demand?
Seasonality Impact: How do prices and booking trends fluctuate throughout the year?
Host Analysis: What are the characteristics of highly-rated hosts?
Reviews and Ratings Analysis: What factors contribute to positive reviews?
Data Analysis Techniques
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Statistical summaries of features like price, location, reviews, and host activity.
Visualization of price trends across different cities and neighborhoods.
Correlation analysis to find relationships between various attributes.
Data Cleaning:

Handling missing data, filtering out outliers, and normalizing certain attributes (e.g., prices).
Date parsing for time-based analysis.
Visualizations:

Distribution plots for price, number of reviews, and availability.
Heatmaps for location-based data.
Time series analysis for seasonal price trends.
Bar charts and pie charts for property types and amenities.
Correlation Analysis:

Finding relationships between property characteristics (e.g., room type, neighborhood) and pricing.
Analyzing the impact of reviews on property popularity.
